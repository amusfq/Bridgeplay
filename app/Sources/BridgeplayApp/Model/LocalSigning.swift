// Creates the self-signed code signing identity that SteamInstaller signs Steam with, so
// Steam's designated requirement (and with it the Input Monitoring approval macOS keys to
// it) stays the same across Bridgeplay updates. Without it Steam is signed ad hoc, the
// requirement is the cdhash, and every update makes macOS forget the controller approval.
//
// Design, checked on macOS 27:
// - The identity lives in a keychain of Bridgeplay's own, in the support folder and outside
//   the user's search list, with a random password. A key that `security import` adds,
//   even with `-T /usr/bin/codesign`, carries a partition list codesign is not in, so in the
//   login keychain macOS asked for the login password once per signed file until the user
//   picked Always Allow. Only the keychain's password can change that list, and Bridgeplay
//   knows this one: `set-key-partition-list -S apple-tool:,apple:,codesign:` runs at
//   creation and codesign never asks.
// - The keychain stays locked except while Steam is signed. Its password is a generic
//   password in the login keychain that only Bridgeplay's signature can read, so other
//   processes can't unlock it and sign as Steam (after Always Allow, any process could run
//   codesign with the login keychain key).
// - Macs that already have the identity in the login keychain keep using it: a new
//   certificate would change Steam's requirement and drop the controller approval once more.
// - The key and certificate come from /usr/bin/openssl. The certificate is NOT marked
//   trusted, so the designated requirement is `certificate leaf = H"<sha1>"`.
// - The name stays "NotProton Local Signing": existing installs look it up by that name.
